# Practical-4

**Aim:** Create an Android Alarm application by using service & BroadcastReceiver.

## Project Description
This application demonstrates how to schedule tasks in Android using the `AlarmManager` and how to handle background tasks using a `Service` and a `BroadcastReceiver`.

### Key Components:
- **MainActivity**: The user interface where users can select a time using a `TimePickerDialog`. It calculates the remaining time and schedules the alarm.
- **AlarmManager**: Used to schedule the alarm at a precise time, even if the application is not running.
- **AlarmBroadcastReceiver**: A background component that wakes up when the alarm triggers. It receives the intent from `AlarmManager` and starts the `AlarmService`.
- **AlarmService**: A background service that manages the playback of the alarm ringtone using `MediaPlayer`. It ensures the music continues playing until the user cancels it.
- **Material Design UI**: Uses `MaterialCardView`, `MaterialButton`, and `TextClock` for a modern, responsive user interface.
